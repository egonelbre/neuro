{"body":"### Who needs this?\r\nThis is designed for learning and studying neural networks, and easy modification of them.\r\n\r\n### How does the simulator work?\r\nThe net simulator is based on three concepts `Node`s `Port`s and `Wire`s.\r\n\r\n* Node : is where the computation happens. It collects input from the input `Port` and calculates a new value for the output `Port`.\r\n* Port : is just for managing wires (for input and output), also if it's for output it also stores the value for node.\r\n* Wire : just connects two ports and signals the `to port` if the `from port` changes.\r\n\r\n`Net` state is updated in two steps. First is the computation phase and the second is the update/signal phase.\r\nIn the computation phase node gets the data from the input port, which collects from all the incoming wires. Then a new value is computed in the `Node` and stored there.\r\n\r\nIn the update/signal phase the `Node` puts the value to the output port. If the output port value changes it sends a signal through each outgoing wire to the connected Nodes. These `Node`s will schedule themselves in the CPU for the next cycle of computation. This scheduling helps to avoid unnecessary calculations (nodes where the input did not change).\r\n\r\n### How does the GUI work?\r\nUses the hud idea.","name":"Neuro","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
